                                   <p>Submarines are underwater self-propelled crafts that are designed and built to perform underwater operations for a stipulated amount of time. Submarine design consists of a single or double hull system that houses all the necessary systems and manpower required for completion of their mission. This, though, is a very simple description of a very complex engineering product, which are used for a wide range of purposes such as underwater research, underwater rescue, and submarine warfare; the last one being the most widely used.</p>
